# 🤖 AI Agents

## 📌 Overview

The **AI Agents Project** is a collection of AI-powered agents built using various frameworks, including LangChain, GenAI, and others. These agents are designed for different tasks, such as automation, decision-making, and natural language processing.

## 🚀 Features

- Implementation of AI agents using multiple frameworks.
- Supports **LangChain**, **GenAI**, and other AI toolkits.
- Modular and scalable architecture for easy expansion.
- Capable of interacting with APIs, processing natural language, and performing automated tasks.
- Includes sample use cases and implementations for different AI-driven workflows.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building AI-driven applications.
- **GenAI**: Generative AI for advanced language models.
- **Streamlit**: For building interactive web-based interfaces.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Naveen035/AI-AGENTS.git
   cd AI-AGENTS
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

1. Select the agent framework (e.g., LangChain, GenAI).
2. Configure the agent parameters in the respective script.
3. Run the agent using:
   ```sh
   python run_agent.py --framework langchain
   ```
4. Observe the agent's output and responses.

## 🏗️ Available Agents
